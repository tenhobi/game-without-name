## âœ¨ About

This game is created as part of my [Bachelor's Thesis](https://github.com/tenhobi/bachelors-thesis) in the Czech language. Due to that, I will not accept any PRs for now.

It uses [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) framework by Google, [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore/) for communication and [Rive](https://rive.app) for some special effects.

The code follows the [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).

## ðŸš€ How to start

### Installation

Following steps will tell you what to install and point you to useful resources:

1. Install [Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart)â€”that might not be required, but some external tools may use it.
1. Install [Flutter and other required tools](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
1. Install Dart & Flutter packages to your IDE.
1. Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) for Android and [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for iOS.
1. *If required, set up an Android or iOS emulator.*

Also, before building the app, make sure to:

- Add `android/app/google-services.json` file, provided by Firebase.

### Running

Run the app using the `flutter run` command.

To learn more, read about building and releasing [an Android app](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android) or [an iOS app](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/ios).

## ðŸ”¨ Tools

### [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy)

This tool is useful for providing display and control of Android devices.

After connecting a phone with a USB, run:

```bash
scrcpy --window-title 'Totally Not Chernobyl' --always-on-top
```
