## âœ¨ About

This game is created as part of my [Bachelor's Thesis](https://github.com/tenhobi/bachelors-thesis), which is written in Czech. Due to that, I will not accept any PRs.

This game is made using the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) framework by Google. It uses [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore/) for communication and [Rive](https://rive.app) for some special effects.

_Note:_ more information will be added during the development.

## ðŸš€ How to start

To run the mobile app using a connected device or a virtual device, download [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) and run `flutter run` command.
