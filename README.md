## âœ¨ About

This project is a game which is created as part of my [Bachelor's Thesis](https://github.com/tenhobi/bachelors-thesis), which is written in Czech.

Name of this game has yet to be invented. See [#3](https://github.com/tenhobi/game-without-name/issues/3) for more info.

This game is made using the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) framework by Google. It uses [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore/) for communication and [Flare](https://www.2dimensions.com/about-flare) for some special effects.

_Note:_ information will be added during the development.

## ðŸš€ How to start
